For the coreference resolution ask, input to systems will be patient
records and markables.  Patient records are found in .txt files and
markables are in .con files.  While the exact output format for the
challenge has not yet been finalized, .pair and .chain files can serve
as starting points.  .pair files mark antecedent and anaphor pairs.
.chain files show complete coreference chains.
