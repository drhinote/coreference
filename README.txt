Rule Based Coreference Program

Author: David Hinote     UHD Summer 2011

This repository contains the source code for the rule based co-reference system 
that was used for the University of Houston - Downtown's participation in the 
2011 I2B2 shared task.  

-If just looking, the entry point is located in Start.java

-To run the program you will need to compile the source code using Java version 1.6 or higher.
You will also need to include a version of SWT (www.eclipse.org/swt) and the MySql connector
library (mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar) included on the build path.  

Sample documents to use with the program can be found in the ./SampleOutput/docs folder .  

Have fun!
